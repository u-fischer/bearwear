The best is to install bearwear with the package manager of your texsystem.

For manual installation compile the .ins file. This will create bearwear.sty and bearwear-doc.tex.
Move bearwear.sty  in <texmf>/tex/latex/bearwear/ and update the filename
database. Compile bearwear.dtx to get the documentation 
 (it will need the extrated bearwear-doc.tex and all the graphics files).
