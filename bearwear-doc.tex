\section{Basic Usage}
\subsection{The shirts}
 The package provides a number of shirts for the bear, \bearwearkey{long sleeves} and \bearwearkey{round neckline} are the defaults:
 \begin{tcblisting}{} 
 \tikz\bearwear % default values
    [long sleeves, round neckline];
 \tikz\bearwear
   [t-shirt];
 \tikz\bearwear
   [muscle shirt];
 \tikz\bearwear
   [v-neckline];
 \tikz\bearwear
   [t-shirt,v-neckline];
 \tikz\bearwear
   [muscle shirt,v-neckline];
  \end{tcblisting}
  
 \subsection{Dressing the bear}
 
 To dress the shirt with the bear, simply add the \verb+\bear+ command from the \bearwearkey{tikzlings-bears} package.
 
 \begin{tcblisting}{}
 \tikz{\bear;\bearwear[v-neckline];}
 \tikz{\bear;\bearwear[muscle shirt];}
  \end{tcblisting}
  
 \subsection{Coloring the shirts}

 The body and the arms of the shirts can be colored:

 \begin{tcblisting}{}
 \tikz{\bear;
       \bearwear
       [v-neckline,
       leftarm=red,body=blue,rightarm=green];}
 \tikz{\bear;\bearwear[arms=green];}
 \tikz{\bear;
       \bearwear
         [shirt=
           {shade,
            top color=blue, 
            bottom color=red}];}
 \end{tcblisting} 
 
 The keys \bearwearkey{arms} and \bearwearkey{shirt} are meta keys which execute the three basic keys \bearwearkey{leftarm}, \bearwearkey{rightarm} and \bearwearkey{body}.
 
 Basically everything that would make sense in a \verb+\fill+ option is allowed here.  Patterns e.g. would work too:
 
 \begin{tcblisting}{}
 \tikz{\bear;
       \bearwear
       [v-neckline,
        shirt  =
         {pattern=
          horizontal lines light blue}];}
 \end{tcblisting} 
 
 
 \subsection{Additional patterns}
 
 As seen in the last example patterns can be added with the previous keys, but sometimes it makes sense to add them on top to preserve a background color. For this the package provides special \texttt{pattern} keys: 
 \bearwearkey{leftarm pattern}, \bearwearkey{rightarm pattern}, \bearwearkey{arms pattern},
 \bearwearkey{body pattern}, \bearwearkey{shirt pattern},
 
 \begin{tcblisting}{}
 \tikz{\bear;
       \bearwear
       [v-neckline,
        shirt=red,
        body pattern = 
         {pattern=
          {Stars[points=6,radius=0.5mm,distance=1.5mm]},
         pattern color=yellow}];}
 \end{tcblisting} 
  
 
  
 \subsection{Decorations}
 
 The \texttt{deco} keys add their value to a \texttt{path picture} key. 
 
 \begin{tcblisting}{}
  \tikz{\bear;
  \bearwear[shirt deco = 
    {\node at (bearcenter) {\includegraphics[width=5cm]{tartan3}};}]}
    
  \tikz{\bear;
   \bearwear[body deco=
    {\node at ([yshift=-1mm]bearchest) {\includegraphics[width=0.3cm]{flag}};}];}  
    
  \tikz{\bear;
   \bearwear[shirt=Beige!80!black,
     body deco=
    {\node at ([yshift=-1mm]bearchest) {\includegraphics[width=0.5cm]{latex-project-logo}};}];}     
  
  \tikz{\bear;
   \bearwear[shirt=HotPink,
     body deco=
    {\path  (bearchest)--++(0,-3mm)pic{hippo};}]}     
 \end{tcblisting}
